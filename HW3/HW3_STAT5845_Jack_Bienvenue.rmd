# Task 3: Replacing Spatial Clustering Map

```{r}

```

```{=tex}
\centering{\red{Question: What can you say about the spatial clustering of housing prices in CT? Why do
Highâ€“High clusters appear in the southwest part of the state?}}

\begin{tcolorbox}
The clustering as shown illuminates the fact that some towns of Southwestern Connecticut---in particular, a subset of Fairfield County's towns---have high average home values, and their neighboring towns do as well.

We notice an absence of the other cluster types.
